How to run under gvisor:

 - gvisor provides the "runsc" binary, and provides documentation on how to configure docker to use it.
 - below is a suitable /etc/docker/daemon.json as an example.
 - notably userns support had to be taken out - note absence of "userns": "default" or similar entry.

{
  "bip": "xx.xx.xx.xx/24",
  "runtimes": {
      "runsc": {
           "path": "/usr/local/bin/runsc",
            "runtimeArgs": [
                "--platform=kvm"
            ]

       }
  }
}
