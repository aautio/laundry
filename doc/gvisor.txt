# How to install gvisor as a container runtime in your Docker setup:
# 
# - gvisor provides the "runsc" binary, and provides documentation on how to configure docker to use it.
# - below is a suitable /etc/docker/daemon.json as an example.
# - notably userns support had to be taken out - note absence of "userns": "default" or similar entry.
#
# note! when run as-is, this will overwrite your docker configuration file.
